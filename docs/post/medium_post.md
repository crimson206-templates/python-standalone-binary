# Create Cross-Platform Python CLI Tools Without Python

*A practical guide to distributing Python applications as standalone executables*

---

Have you ever created a useful Python CLI tool but struggled to share it with non-Python users? Here's a solution that doesn't require explaining pip installation or Python version compatibility to your end users.

## What We're Solving

Traditional Python distribution methods often create barriers:
- Users need Python installed
- Dependency conflicts
- Installation complexity
- Platform-specific issues

## The Simple Solution

We've created a template that handles all the complexity for you. Your users just need to run:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/install.sh | bash

# Windows
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

That's it. No Python required.

## How to Use the Template

1. Clone the template
2. Add your Python CLI code
3. Push a new version tag
4. GitHub Actions automatically creates:
   - Windows executable
   - Linux binary
   - macOS binary

## Behind the Scenes

While we could dive deep into PyInstaller configurations, GitHub Actions workflows, and binary distribution strategies, we won't. Instead, we've packaged all that complexity into a template that "just works."

The template handles:
- Cross-platform builds
- Automatic releases
- Installation scripts
- Platform detection
- Binary distribution

## Getting Started

Visit our [template repository](https://github.com/crimson206-templates/python-standalone-binary) to start building. The documentation is intentionally minimal, focusing on what you need to know rather than how everything works.

## Why This Approach?

We believe in practical solutions. While understanding the internals of Python packaging is valuable, sometimes you just need to ship a tool that works. This template bridges the gap between Python development and end-user distribution.
